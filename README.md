# SecureCampaign
SecureCampaign facilitates ultra secure crowd funding capaigns by using ethereum's blockchain to store critical information that must not be meddled with.

It functions like any other website that facilitates crowd funding but the information is stored in a blockchain via transactions on ethereum's network.
The contributers and approvers receive and send money through their ethereum accounts.
The Campaign owner can request for a transaction and it only proceeds through if more than threshold limit of approvers approve the request. 
The backend of this campaign is managed by a smart contract that was deployed at the initiation of this campaign.
